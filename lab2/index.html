    <h1>Report</h1>
    <h3>Elements</h3>
    <p>I used h1 tags for all the headings, plus i also used anchor tag to add links. I used image tag
        to insert my image in About Myself. I used Nav tag to insert a nav bar. I used section tag for each 4 section. I assigned them a unique id.</p>
    <h3>styling</h3>
    <p>I used sky blue color in backgroud and gave white kind of shade in the background of nav bar.
        the clickable links of navbar are in blue color. whereas all other links are in red color
        I aligned all headings in the center and also change their fonts to "Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif".
    </p>
    <h3>What I learnt in this lab</h3>
    <p>I did practice of various tags and selector, which was really helpful. beacuse in theory and practical there 
        is much difference. so in this lab I did things practically.
